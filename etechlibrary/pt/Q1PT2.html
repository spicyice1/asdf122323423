            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
               <b>Stoichiometry is a branch of chemistry that examines the relationships between elements and compounds in chemical reactions.</b> Balancing chemical equations is an integral part of stoichiometry. In chemistry, reactions are often written as equations using symbols. Chemical equations show the reactants on the left side, while the products are on the right. To balance a chemical equation, one must ensure that the number of atoms of the reactants equals that of the products.

            <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
               In this laboratory worksheet exercise, we applied various concepts and formulas of stoichiometry to solve the problems. These concepts include balancing chemical equations, mass-to-mass conversions, theoretical yield, and limiting and excess reagents.

            <h1>Discussion</h1>
            <p>
               Stoichiometry is a fundamental and complicated branch of chemistry. <b>To balance a chemical equation, it is crucial to ensure that the number of atoms of the reactants matches that of the products.</b> This can be done by adjusting the coefficients of the elements or compounds. Mole conversion formulas are complex, as they require following multiple steps to solve correctly. The theoretical yield represents the ideal amount of product, assuming that the reaction proceeds perfectly with no losses or side reactions. Determining the theoretical yield involves following a specific formula. The limiting reagent is the reactant that is completely consumed first during a chemical reaction, while the excess reagent is the reactant that remains after the limiting reagent has been used up.
            </p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
               In conclusion, stoichiometry is an essential component of chemistry that provides a foundation for understanding chemical reactions and their quantitative relationships. Through this exploration, we demonstrated how balancing chemical equations ensures that reactions adhere to the law of conservation of mass, maintaining equilibrium between reactants and products. The laboratory exercises highlighted the importance of mastering stoichiometry concepts, such as mass-to-mass conversions, theoretical yield calculations, and the identification of limiting and excess reagents. These skills are crucial for accurately predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions, which are valuable in both academic and real-world settings.

            <h1>How is Balancing Chemical Equations Used in Real Life?</h1>
            <p>
               Stoichiometry plays a vital role in medicine, particularly in drug development and therapies. In chemotherapy, it is essential to determine the right drug quantities needed to effectively target cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy cells. It is also crucial for determining optimal drug dosages and understanding the chemical reactions that occur in the body. Balanced chemical equations are similar to recipes, demonstrating how stoichiometric relationships enable the calculation of substance amounts in reactions. Overall, stoichiometry is a principle that applies not only in laboratories but also in many real-life situations.
